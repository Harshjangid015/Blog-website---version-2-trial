```

Each blog post has the following structure:

## ‚ûï How to Add a New Blog Post

To manually add a new blog post:

1. Open the JavaScript file.
2. Locate the `const blogPosts = [...]` array.
3. Add a new object at the end (or start) of the array with the structure described above:

```js
{
    id: 11, // Make sure it's unique
    title: "Your Blog Title",
    excerpt: "Short summary of your blog",
    image: "img/blog.jpeg",
    author: "Your Name",
    authorAvatar: "img/avatar.png",
    date: "4 July 2025",
    dateSort: new Date("2025-07-04"),
    tags: ["your", "tags"],
    category: "writings",
    content: `
        <p>This is the content of the blog.</p>
        <h2>Subheading</h2>
        <p>More content goes here...</p>
    `
}
```

## üìå Notes

* Make sure `id` is unique to avoid rendering conflicts.
* To make sure the category is working fine, enter the category field correctly. There are a total of 4 categories "cases" "writings" "book-nook" "archives"
