            <h1>Judicial Opinions in <em>Gayatri Balasamy v. ISG Novasoft<sup>1</sup></em></h1>
            <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Can Courts Modify Arbitral Awards?</p>

            <p>In a landmark decision delivered in 2025, the Supreme Court of India addressed a long-standing question in arbitration law—whether courts under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, have the power to modify arbitral awards. The judgment resulted in a split opinion. While the majority view supported limited modification powers under specific circumstances, the minority opposed it, emphasizing party autonomy and the sanctity of arbitral proceedings.</p>

            <h2>Majority View</h2>

            <p>The court has a limited power under Sections 34 and 37 to modify an arbitral award. This limited power may be exercised under the following circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When the award is severable, by separating the “invalid” portion from the “valid” portion.</li>
                <li>By correcting clerical, computational, or typographical errors which are apparent on the face of the record.</li>
                <li>Post-award interest may be modified in some circumstances.</li>
                <li>Article 142 of the Constitution applies but must be used with great caution and should not result in rewriting or modifying the award on merits.</li>
                <li>The power can be exercised to bring finality to litigation, not to reopen merit-based issues.</li>
                <li>Setting aside an award includes the power to do so in part, where the invalid and valid parts can be clearly separated.</li>
                <li>Section 34 implies limited power to modify, even though the 1996 Act does not expressly state it.</li>
                <li>The court can correct evident errors without conducting a merit-based review.</li>
                <li>If there is any doubt about the appropriateness of the modification, the court should refrain and redirect to Section 33 or 34(4).</li>
                <li>The court may intervene to modify post-award interest if justified by circumstances arising after the award.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Minority View</h2>

            <p>The minority held that courts exercising powers under Section 34 or appeals thereunder do <strong>not</strong> have the power to modify an award:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arbitration is a consensual process. Courts cannot enter a merits review under Section 34 unless expressly permitted by law.</li>
                <li>The power to modify is not subsumed in the power to set aside—both are qualitatively different.</li>
                <li>Severance (partial setting aside) is permissible, but not modification.</li>
                <li>Modification entails adjudicating on merits, which is outside the scope of Section 34.</li>
                <li>The court cannot modify even the interest component—if needed, the matter should be remitted under Section 34(4).</li>
                <li>Article 142 powers should not override the statutory scheme of the Arbitration Act.</li>
                <li>Granting such modification powers creates uncertainty for contracting parties and undermines arbitration as an effective resolution mechanism.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<p>This paper examines the critical issue of misleading advertisements in the pharmaceutical industry, with a particular focus on the Indian market. As healthcare products remain one of the most popular and best-selling categories in India, the proliferation of drug advertisements has significantly shaped public perceptions and consumer behaviour. However, the line between truthful representation and misleading claims is often blurred, raising serious concerns about public health and safety.</p>

<p>The study provides an overview of various medicine systems in India, including allopathic and AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa, and Homeopathy) treatments. It then delves into the nature of misleading advertisements, exploring tactics such as selective reporting of data and overstating benefits while downplaying risks. The paper examines notable cases, including the Patanjali advertisement controversy, to illustrate the real-world implications of such practices.</p>

<p>The research outlines the existing regulatory framework in India, including the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, 1954, and recent directives from the Supreme Court. It discusses the challenges faced by regulatory bodies in keeping pace with evolving marketing strategies, particularly in the digital age.</p>

<p>The paper argues that while pharmaceutical companies have the right to advertise their products, there is a pressing need to balance this right with ethical considerations and public health concerns. It emphasizes the importance of truthful, informative, and balanced advertising in the pharmaceutical sector.</p>

<p><strong>Key words:</strong> misleading advertisements, pharmaceutical industries, drug advertisements, AYUSH.</p>

<h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Advertisements play a pivotal role in setting a brand in spotlight and capture consumer attention. Taglines like, <em>“Red Bull gives you wings” </em>and Surf Excel’s <em> “Daag acche hain” </em>have left a lasting impression on all of us. Accordingly, the proliferation of advertisements in the pharmaceutical industry has significantly shaped public perceptions and consumer behaviour in the healthcare sector. These advertisements generally aim at educating people about various treatment options and promote health products.</p>

<p>Healthcare is one of the most popular and best-selling product categories in India. Healthcare is a high-demand product sector, hence popular healthcare marketing campaigns in India are released throughout the year. In the Indian market, various well-known Indian and International healthcare brands compete for market shares. As a result, healthcare advertising in India is essential for capturing the audience’s attention. Television, digital-media, newspaper, radio, cinema, magazines, and other prominent channels are frequently used to display the most recent healthcare advertisements. Most of these advertisers seek to highlight product characteristics and advantages over competitors while also attempting to develop an emotional connection with the consumer. However, the line between truthful representation and misleading claims is often blurred by these advertisements.</p>

<p>The Advertising Standards Council of India released its Annual Complaints Report in May 2024, providing a thorough examination of advertisements deemed objectionable in the FY 2023–2024. The ASCI reviewed 10,093 complaints and looked into 8,299 advertisements and found that 81% of the violations were due to misleading claims. Of these, the healthcare industry accounted for 19% of the total violations, with 1249 of the 1575 ads violative of the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act of 1954.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>Given the importance of ads in shaping public perception of healthcare items, the consequences of misleading claims are especially concerning when it comes to drugs. Drugs, as opposed to general healthcare goods, are directly involved in the treatment and management of medical conditions, and erroneous or exaggerated claims can result in improper use, poor health effects, and a breakdown in confidence between patients and healthcare providers. As a result, the veracity of drug ads affects not only consumer information but also public health and safety.</p>

<h2>2. OVERVIEW OF MEDICINES</h2>

<p>A medicine can be generally described as a substance or preparation capable of treating or preventing disease. In the past, most of the medicines were derived from natural ingredients. Progress in the last two centuries resulted in the advent of man-made chemical treatments, gene therapies, and biologicals.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Medicines may be given via injections, sprays, lotions, drops, or pills. Oral medications travel via stomach, intestines, & liver before reaching the blood flowing through the circulatory system. Most of the injections, sprays, & drops go round the digestive system and liver, but must pass through cell membranes to enter the bloodstream. Intravenous injections are administered directly into the bloodstream via a vein. When a drug enters the bloodstream, it is transported throughout the body and should reach the organs and cells that require it. The final stage involves the liver breaking down the drug. Blood transports the drugs to the liver. In the end, they are broken down into molecules that can be eliminated from the body. The majority of water-soluble medications are eliminated through urine, whereas others are released in faeces.</p>

<p>Any chemical or biological substance that has an effect on the body's processes is referred to as a drug. FDA defines drug as <em>“A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.”</em><sup>3</sup> Drugs are classified into 2 types: prescription pharmaceuticals and nonprescription substances. Prescription medications, which are regarded safe for use under medical supervision only, can only be administered with a prescription from a medical practitioner. Nonprescription drugs are characterised safe for use even without medical supervision — are available over the counter.</p>

<p>Each medicine generally has 3 names: chemical name, generic name, and brand name. The drug's atomic or molecular structure is described by the chemical name. The generic names for medications of a specific type (class) typically have the same termination. The brand name is decided by the pharmaceutical business that produces or distributes the drug.<sup>4</sup></p>

<h2>3. AYUSH SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE</h2>

<p>AYUSH is short for Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homeopathy<sup>5</sup>. Just like the people themselves, their medicinal preferences are also diverse in India. As lifestyle-related diseases and disorders increase globally, there is a growing revival of interest in holistic healthcare systems, especially for preventing and managing chronic, non-communicable, and systemic diseases. It is becoming increasingly clear that no single healthcare system can adequately address all the health needs of today's society. Consequently, there is an evident need for a new, and integrated healthcare approach to guide future health policies and programs. India has an upper hand in this global rejuvenation of interest in holistic therapies, given its rich heritage of indigenous medicinal knowledge. Medical pluralism is set to persist, and the AYUSH sector is poised to play a crucial role in this emerging field. The Ministry of AYUSH is dedicated to promoting and propagating Indian systems of medicine, with a commitment to blending the wisdom of traditional medicines with the methods of modern science, scientifically validating these systems, and presenting them in a manner that aligns with modern lifestyles.<sup>6</sup></p>

<p>AYUSH provides a very holistic and personalised approach to well-being that takes into account physical, mental and emotional factors. These treatments are frequently customised according to each individual’s needs.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>Ayurvedic medicines are personalized according to each person’s specific constitution, or Dosha, which is determined by physical and emotional aspects. Imbalances in the Doshas are generally believed to be the source of the disease. Ayurvedic treatments attempts to restore the balance through lifestyle changes, herbal remedies and other therapies.</p>

<p>Yoga is thought to boost overall health and well-being by increasing physical, mental, and emotional health. It consists of a series of postures, or asanas, that are intended to improve flexibility, strength, and balance, as well as breathing techniques and meditation to encourage relaxation and stress reduction. Naturopathy, on the other hand, is a medical system that emphasises natural medicines and therapies to help the body repair itself. Herbal cures, nutritional and dietary counselling, hydrotherapy, massage, and other natural therapies are examples of naturopathic treatments. Yoga and Naturopathy work together to provide a holistic approach to health and wellness, emphasising the body's intrinsic potential to heal. The mind-body practices of yoga, along with the natural therapies of Naturopathy, can assist individuals in achieving more balance and harmony in their physical, mental, and emotional health.</p>

<p>Unani medicine is founded on the notion of balance, which believes that good health is a result of maintaining a balance of the four humours: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. The diagnosis is made after examining the patient's pulse, urine, and stool, as well as reviewing their medical history and symptoms. Unani treatments involve natural medicines such as herbs, minerals, and animal products to restore balance and promote healing. Treatments may include nutrition, herbal medication, massage, and cupping therapy.</p>

<p>Siddha medicine focuses on achieving equilibrium between the body’s five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. It believes that good health is a product of harmony between these elements, and diseases are caused whenever there is any imbalance. Siddha medicine approaches health and wellness holistically, taking into account an individual's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Illness is diagnosed by examining the patient's pulse, urine, and other bodily fluids, as well as reviewing their medical history and symptoms. Siddha treatments restore balance and promote healing by combining herbal remedies, diet and nutrition, massage, and yoga techniques.</p>

<p>Homoeopathy believes in <em>"like cures like"</em> theory. It states that a drug that can induce symptoms in a healthy person can also be used to treat comparable symptoms in a sick person. Homoeopathic treatments are derived from natural substances such as plants, minerals, and animal products and are extensively diluted to ensure their safety and non-toxicity. The remedies are chosen depending on the individual's specific symptoms, and the purpose of the treatment is to encourage the body's natural healing processes while also restoring balance and harmony. Homoeopathic therapies are safe, gentle, and non-invasive, making them an excellent alternative for kids, pregnant women, and people with sensitive bodies.</p>

<h2>4. MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENTS</h2>

<p>Misleading advertisement refers to an advertisement that misleads, manipulates, deceives, or has the potential to mislead, manipulate or deceive the consumer. It is also defined under §2(28)<sup>8</sup> of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. These commercials must be controlled as they have the potential to seriously harm both competitors and consumers. In numerous instances, the courts have attempted to strike a balance between protecting the freedom to commercial speech and the interests of consumers and competitors.</p>

<p>Article 19(1)(a) as enshrined in the Indian Constitution provides for the right to freedom of speech and expression; right to be informed and access to information being its essential corollary. Commercial speech comes within the scope of this article, according to the Supreme Court<sup>9</sup> – <em>“all commercial advertisements cannot be denied the protection of Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution merely because they are issued by businessmen and its true character is detected by the object for the promotion of which it is employed.”</em></p>

<p>Basically, drug promotion refers to all the informational and persuasive operations of the pharmaceutical industries that have the effect of inducing prescription, supply, purchase, and usage of medicinal drugs. Pharmaceutical industries have the right to advertise their products in India, but they must do it fairly, accurately, and ethically. Pharmaceutical advertising must be trustworthy, truthful, informative, relevant and balanced. Nevertheless, despite the fact that modern advertising techniques are highly sophisticated and successful, it has been discovered that the pharmaceutical industry violate these ethical standards when promoting their goods. As a result, these usually end in the irrational use of medicines. Supreme Court while observing the consumer’s right as a recipient of commercial speech in the case of <strong>Tata Press Ltd v Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd<sup>10</sup></strong> stated that <em>“an advertisement giving information regarding a life-saving drug may be of much more importance to the general public than to the advertiser who may be having purely a trade consideration”</em>. It concluded that misleading or deceptive ads wouldn’t be protected under Article 19.</p>

<p>There’s a thin line of difference between glorifying one’s own product in an advertisement and an advertisement being false and deceptive. While it is natural for pharmaceutical companies to emphasise the benefits of their drugs, the selective reporting of data and overstating advantages while downplaying risks can lead to misinformation. Such advertisements can create a distorted image of the drug’s effectiveness and safety, leaving consumers misinformed about the true nature of the medication.</p>

<h3>4.1 SELECTIVE REPORTING OF DATA</h3>
<p>Selective reporting of data is one of the most common tactics used in misleading drug advertisements. Pharmaceutical companies may highlight favourable studies or outcomes while omitting data that does not support their claims. This selective presentation paints an incomplete picture for both healthcare professionals and patients, often leading to misguided decisions regarding the use of the drug. For example, if an ad emphasises the efficacy of a drug without acknowledging its side effects or contraindications, consumers may be unaware of potential risks, leading to adverse health consequences.</p>

<h3>4.2 OVERSTATING BENEFITS WHILE DOWNPLAYING RISKS</h3>
<p>Overstating the benefits of a drug while downplaying its risks is another common strategy used to influence consumer behaviour. Advertisements may focus on the positive effects, such as fast relief or long-term benefits, while minimising or omitting information about side effects, drug interactions, or contraindications. Such practices can have serious implications for public health, particularly when drugs are promoted for off-label uses or for conditions where benefits are not clearly established.</p>

<p>By downplaying risks, these advertisements mislead consumers into believing that the drug is safer or more effective than it actually is, potentially resulting in the irrational use of medicines. For instance, when Allergan introduced its eyelash thickening drug, Latisse, the company launched a major marketing campaign featuring actress Brooke Shields. The advertisements highlighted the drug's ability to enhance lash thickness and length, but provided little emphasis on its more serious side effects. These involved unintended hair growth outside the treatment area, permanent darkening of the eye colour, and bacterial infections that could even result in blindness. The promotional material focused heavily on the cosmetic benefits while downplaying the potential health risks, leaving consumers unaware of the possible dangers.<sup>11</sup></p>

<h3>4.3 CASE STUDIES</h3>

<p>Indian drug manufacturers and regulators are struggling to strike a balance between ensuring the drug quality, which leads to high manufacturing costs, and keeping consumer prices down so that patients can afford it. Unfortunately, regulators and manufacturers have failed to effectively address this issue in a way that truly prioritizes the needs and well-being of patients.</p>

<p>The actions of the AYUSH Ministry have further complicated the situation by permitting businesses to register a wide range of products as "Ayurvedic" and by seemingly bypassing existing quality standards, likely to facilitate business operations. On 1st July, 2024, AYUSH ministry through a notification omitted Rule 170 of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, which aimed to regulate misleading advertisements of Ayurvedic, Siddha, and Unani drugs. However, the Supreme Court has temporarily put a halt on the notification.</p>

<h4>➤ HAMDARD DAWAKHANA V. UNION OF INDIA<sup>12</sup></h4>
<p>It is a significant case dealing with the advertisement of prohibited drugs under the Drug and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisement) Act; whereby objections were raised against the advertisements of medicinal drugs prepared by petitioner. The petitioner had contended that these were prepared according to Unani system and had their names accordingly. The respondent counter-argued that the restriction was with regard to the advertisement to the public in general and that the act aimed at preventing people having serious disease, from self-medicating. It would be beneficial for the public health that the puffing up of advertisements be put to a complete check.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court opined that <em>“an advertisement is no doubt a form of speech but its true character is reflected by the object for the promotion of which it is employed… when it takes the form of a commercial advertisement which has an element of trade or commerce it no longer falls within the concept of freedom of speech… but as in the present case the commendation of the efficacy, value and importance in treatment of particular diseases by certain drugs and medicines”</em>.</p>

<h4>➤ PATANJALI ADVERTISEMENT CASE<sup>13</sup></h4>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Patanjali made bold claims that its product “Coronil” was effective in curing COVID-19 and even asserted that it was certified and approved by the WHO. However, the WHO later refuted this claim and publicly criticised the company for misleading the public. In response to the criticism, Patanjali shifted its focus, launching several additional claims against the pharmaceutical industry, stating that its medicines were fully capable of curing various diseases and were superior to allopathic treatments.</p>

<p>In 2022, Patanjali faced controversy for running a poster titled <em>“Misconceptions Spread by Allopathy: Save Yourself and the Country from Misconceptions Spread through the Pharma and Medical Industry.”</em> In this advertisement, Patanjali claimed that its medicines were scientifically validated to cure a range of diseases, while also alleging that allopathic treatments often result in serious side effects. The Indian Medical Association responded by filing a defamation notice against Patanjali, seeking damages of ₹1000 crore under Section 499 IPC.</p>

<p>Subsequently, in August 2022, the IMA filed a petition in the Supreme Court regarding the disparaging nature of Patanjali’s advertisements. During a hearing in November 2023, the Supreme Court issued a stern warning to Patanjali, cautioning the company against using misleading terms like “permanent relief” in relation to its products, emphasizing the restrictions under the Drugs and Magic Remedies Act, 1954.</p>

<h4>➤ NEOLACTA CASE</h4>
<p>A Bangalore based company named Neolacta was processing and selling human milk. According to the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, sale or any commercial activity which involves human milk is prohibited. Neolacta was initially functioning with a license from FSSAI’s Karnataka office in the category of dairy products. Subsequently, it continued functioning by getting a license from the AYUSH department, claiming their products to be ayurvedic proprietary medicine. It was alleged that the company was indulged in processing and selling human breastmilk which was collected from poor women in exchange of money illegally; which is unethical and illegal. After this the AYUSH department cancelled the license. However, the company is still functioning on an interim stay from Karnataka High Court.<sup>14</sup></p>

<h2>5. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK</h2>

<p>The Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI)<sup>15</sup> and national legislation govern drug promotion in India to a great extent. However, implementing the OPPI's code of ethics requires self-regulation and discipline.</p>

<p>Section 3(d)<sup>16</sup> of the Drugs and Magical Remedies Act, 1954 says <em>“No person shall take part in the publication of any advertisement referring to any drug in terms which suggest or are calculated to lead to the use of that drug for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of any disease, disorder or condition specified in the Schedule, or any other disease, disorder or condition (by whatsoever name called) which may be specified in the rules made under this Act.”</em></p>

<p>Direct-to-consumer advertising is essential for almost every organisation. However, DTC advertising has always been a problem to Indian pharmaceutical industries. DTCA is an instrument used by pharmaceutical companies to market & promote medicines directly to customers via various media. DTC advertising of pharmaceutical items is unlawful in many parts of the world. The US and New Zealand are the only two countries that have legalised DTC advertising, but the internet has removed all the hurdles. Prescription pharmaceutical advertising on the internet and social media has made it difficult for governments and regulatory authorities to properly administer regulations governing DTCA. Despite existing legislation prohibiting the advertisement of pharmaceuticals in specific disease cases, lucrative ads for drugs and medical remedies are widely available in Indian mass media presently. These commercials appeal to vulnerable consumers, increasing the risk of self-medication.</p>

<p>In India, DTC advertising is only authorised for the drugs sold over-the-counter. However, as OTC doesn’t have legal recognition in India, all drugs that are not on the list of ‘prescription drugs’ are deemed nonprescription drugs. The Drug and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 prohibit the use of DTCA for medications listed in Schedules H and X. Drugs falling under Schedule G require the following mandatory warning on the label — <strong>“Caution: It is dangerous to take this preparation except under medical supervision”</strong> — and are thus not allowed to be advertised DTC because of their toxicity and their potential harmful effects due to inappropriate and unnecessary use.<sup>17</sup></p>

<p>Also, according to the <strong>Indian Medical Associations v UOI<sup>18</sup> (2022)</strong>, advertising companies must present a self-declaratory certificate to the appropriate authorities before any content is published, as directed by the Supreme Court. Advertisers now need to declare that their ads do not make untrue statements. In subsequent development, the Union government withdrew an AYUSH Ministry letter, which “omitted” Rule 170 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945.</p>

<p>The Indian government has taken steps to combat misleading advertisements for Ayush drugs. The <strong>Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954</strong> and its accompanying Rules prohibit misleading advertisements and exaggerated claims for drugs and medicinal substances, including Ayush medicines, in print and electronic media. The Act and its Rules allow state/UT governments to enforce their provisions.</p>

<p><strong>Pharmacovigilance Centres</strong> for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and Homoeopathy Drugs, established across the country under the Central Sector <em>'Ayush Oushadhi Gunvatta Evam Uttpadan Samvardhan Yojana'</em> Scheme of the Ministry of Ayush, are tasked with monitoring and reporting misleading advertisements to the relevant State Regulatory Authorities.</p>

<p>A 3-tier organisation consisting of a National Pharmacovigilance Coordination Centre (NPvCC), Intermediary Pharmacovigilance Centres (IPvCs), and Peripheral Pharmacovigilance Centres (PPvCs) is created. The All-India Institute of Ayurveda, New Delhi, is the NPvCC for the National Pharmacovigilance Program for Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and Homoeopathy medications.<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>The <strong>DoCA's Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements (GAMA)</strong> portal allows consumers to report misleading commercials. Furthermore, because TV Channel laws and enforcement are within the purview of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MOIB), any reports of deceptive advertisements shown on TV channels are referred to MOIB for action.<sup>20</sup></p>

<h2>6. CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Misleading advertisements not only endanger consumer health, but also raise ethical and legal concerns. Pharmaceutical companies, motivated by profit, may resort to dubious marketing strategies that prioritize sales over patient safety. This raises a tension between business interests and ethical commitments to deliver accurate information. The regulatory framework, which is intended to prohibit these tactics, frequently struggles to keep up with the innovative and sometimes deceptive marketing strategies used by these businesses.</p>

<p>As pharmaceutical advertisements continue to influence both healthcare professionals and consumers, it becomes increasingly critical to strike a balance between the right to commercial speech and the protection of public health. Misleading ads that promote drugs with partial or exaggerated information compromise this balance.</p>

<p>To address these challenges, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. First, there is a need for stronger enforcement of existing regulations, with more significant penalties for companies that engage in misleading advertising practices. The regulatory bodies should be empowered with resources and authority to monitor and act swiftly against violations.</p>

<p>Second, there should be increased transparency in drug advertising. Pharmaceutical companies should be required to disclose all relevant information about their products, including potential side effects and limitations, in a clear and accessible manner. This would enable consumers to make more informed decisions about their health.</p>

<p>Third, education plays a crucial role. Both healthcare professionals and the general public should be educated about how to critically evaluate drug advertisements and recognize potentially misleading claims. This could be incorporated into medical curricula and public health campaigns.</p>

<p>Fourth, the self-regulatory mechanisms within the pharmaceutical industry need to be strengthened. Industry associations should take a more proactive role in setting and enforcing ethical standards for drug advertising.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a need for ongoing research and dialogue on the impact of drug advertisements on public health. This would help in developing policies and guidelines for pharmaceutical marketing.</p>

             <h2>VEREIN KLIMASENIORINNEN SCHWEIZ AND OTHERS v. SWITZERLAND<sup>1</sup></h2>

             <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The crossroads between climate change and human rights is one of the most dynamic areas of contemporary times. This case analysis examines the landmark judgment from European Court of Human Rights, <em>Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz and Others v. Switzerland</em> (2024), that have shaped this emerging field by highlighting the evolving approach to climate change litigation through human rights mechanisms. The Court established that inadequate climate action can violate the rights of vulnerable populations. It demonstrates the Court’s increasing willingness to recognize climate related harms within traditional human rights framework. This sheds light and acknowledges that climate change threatens not only environmental integrity but also fundamental human rights.</p>

<p>This analysis examines how the case contributes to this developing jurisprudential nexus, exploring its factual background, key legal issues, judicial reasoning, and its significance.</p>

<h2>Facts</h2>

<p>This case is the first climate litigation to reach judgment at the European Court of Human Rights whereby an association of senior women (KlimaSeniorinnen) and four individual women approached the ECtHR. They sought to hold the Swiss government accountable for its inadequate climate policies. They argued that Switzerland’s climate policies are disproportionately affecting their fundamental rights under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). As the association comprised around 2,000 elderly women, their contention was that they are particularly more vulnerable to heat-related health risks which has taken a turn for the worse as a consequence of climate crisis. Scientific evidences were also cited showing higher mortality rates among Swiss elderly women during heat waves, making them more vulnerable as compared to other demographic groups. They had approached the ECtHR after a series of unsuccessful attempts made by them seeking remedy through domestic courts, which rejected their claims primarily on procedural grounds like lack of standing and no sufficient individualization of harm from climate change.</p>

<p>The applicants had also alleged the violations of right to life, right to respect for private and family life, and right to fair trial, i.e., Articles 2, 8 and 6 of the ECHR<sup>2</sup> respectively; due to Swiss government’s failure to effectively implement appropriate climate action and policies, and domestic court’s refusal to examine their claims on merits.</p>

<h2>Key Issues</h2>

<p>Some of the critical legal issues that were raised in the case are:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Whether the applicants had the locus standi under Article 34 ECHR<sup>3</sup>.”</em></p>

<p>The issue particularly centered on whether climate change impacts could constitute a sufficiently individualized threat to establish victim status.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Whether climate inaction could violate Article 2 and Article 8 of ECHR.”</em></p>

<p>This issue dealt whether the inadequacy of the past state action violated the right to life and right to private and family life of the applicants; what is the extent of State responsibility and positive obligation of the state regarding climate change.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Whether denial of access to domestic courts violates the right to fair trial under Article 6
and the right to an effective remedy under Article 13<sup>4</sup>.”</em></p>

<h2>Judgment</h2>

<p>This judgment of Grand Chamber in this case has marked several crucial developments in human rights jurisprudence. On the issue of victim status, the court looked into the applicants’ intensity of exposure and level of severity of adverse effects of climate change and its link to governmental action or inaction. The court recognized that the association and its members as qualifying victims, and found that older women constitute a demographically identifiable group with high vulnerability to heat related health risk caused by climate change. The Court determined that when an association brings a climate related claim representing its members, it is not necessary to separately establish that each individual member would independently satisfy the victim status requirement. Rather, the association itself can qualify as a victim. However, the court also ruled that the 4 individual applicants did not fulfil the criteria of victim status under the convention.</p>

<p>The Court also found that Switzerland had contravened its positive obligations to establish adequate domestic regulatory framework and to protect the rights of vulnerable groups against adverse effects of climate change. The authorities have not acted appropriately in devising and implementing the necessary measures in this regard.</p>

<p>The Court joined the issue of locus standi and the applicability of Article 6. It held that the rejection of the association’s application without assessing the contents and merits of it had limited their right of access to a court. The domestic courts did not look into the scientific evidences and the potential future impacts of climate change and its influence on various facets of human rights. It also held that the very essence of the right under Article 6 has been impaired.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Climate change in the recent times has become a pressing concern. This case expands the traditional scope of human rights protection to encompass climate change impacts. The case dealing with the issue of locus standi has broadened the understanding of victim status by accepting that a particular demographic group can demonstrate their particular vulnerability to issues like climate change. This has facilitated the vulnerable population to seek climate justice through human rights mechanism. It has clarified that an association in itself can also be a victim if it is able to show that its collective interests are directly affected by the state action or inaction. It need not require individual victim status verification for every individual it is representing.</p>

<p>The judgment has also developed the positive obligations doctrine by requiring states to come up with climate actions to protect human rights. This means that the ruling has focused more on actively safeguarding human rights, rather than passively monitoring the non-violation of the same. It also found that Switzerland’s emission reduction trajectory was not in line with its international commitments under the Paris Agreement<sup>5</sup>. The court also took into consideration the potential and inevitable future risks of climate change which can be termed as a significant evolution in the court’s jurisprudence. Traditionally, the approach taken by the court was that it required demonstrable harm but in this present case it also gave a thought to the anticipatory protection.</p>

<p>This decision has also enhanced the procedural rights in the matters concerning environmental cases by requiring the domestic courts to examine the content and the merits of the claims. This has created a precedent for similar cases across Europe and potentially influencing courts globally. In the long run, this judgment will likely influence the jurisprudential aspects of human rights litigations all across the globe.</p>
